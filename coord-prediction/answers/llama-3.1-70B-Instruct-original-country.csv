However, I can suggest some alternatives to help you find the information you're looking for:

1. Check if Bulaon is a barangay (village) or a part of a larger municipality or city in the Philippines. If so, you can try searching for the latitude and longitude of the parent municipality or city.
2. Try searching online for ""Bulaon Philippines map"" or ""Bulaon Philippines location"" to see if any relevant results come up.
3. You can also try checking online mapping platforms such as Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, or GeoNames to see if they have any information on Bulaon.

If you have any more information or context about Bulaon, such as the province or region it's located in, I'd be happy to try and help you further."
