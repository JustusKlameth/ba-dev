As such, Timon is not a real-world location, so it does not have a latitude and longitude.

However, if you're interested in knowing the location of the Pride Lands, the fictional setting of ""The Lion King"", it's loosely based on the savannas and grasslands of Africa. But since it's a fictional setting, it doesn't have a specific latitude and longitude either.

If you meant to ask about a different Timon, could you please provide more context or information about which Timon you're referring to? I'd be happy to help if I can!"

Unfortunately, ""paradise"" is a subjective concept and can refer to different places or ideas depending on personal beliefs, cultural backgrounds, or individual experiences. As a result, there isn't a specific latitude and longitude that can be universally agreed upon as the coordinates of ""paradise.""

In various cultures and religions, paradise is often depicted as a mythical or heavenly realm, rather than a physical location on Earth. For example, in Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, paradise is often associated with the afterlife or a spiritual realm, rather than a specific geographic location.

If you're looking for a beautiful or idyllic place on Earth, there are many stunning destinations that might fit the bill, but the concept of ""paradise"" is ultimately a matter of personal interpretation.
